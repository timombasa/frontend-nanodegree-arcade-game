Classic Arcade Game - Frogger
===============================

This game has a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can be controlled using the keyboard direction keys to move left, right, up and down. The enemies move automatically in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the canvas. When the player collides with an enemy the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting point. However, when the player reaches the water the game is won.

Additional Functionality:
------------------------

I have added a score counter at the bottom of the screen. When the player collides with a bug, 20 points are lost. But when the player reaches the water, 20 points are gained.
